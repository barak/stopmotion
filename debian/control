Description: create stop-motion animations
 Create stop-motion animations with images grabbed from a video
 device, or from image files, or from still images extracted from
 video.  Stopmotion has a set of tools which helps you keep the
 movements smooth and precise, such as ghosting the last image on a
 live view of the next image to be acquired.
